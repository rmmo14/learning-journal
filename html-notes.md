# Design and Process

When building a site it is important to consider a few factors. 

First, **who is the site for**? Who is your target audience considering location, community, average income, devices the community has, how often they use the web, etc. It is good practice to ask the client their target audience. But it is hard to please *everyone*. 

**Hypotheticals** - make hypthetical characters based on your typical target audience. Making sure audequate qualities and data to make a statistical analysis. 

Second, **why people visit the site**? To determine why people are coming to your site, ask:

1. Attempt to discover the motivations for why visitors come to the site. 
1. Examine the goals of the visitor. 

Third, **what visitors are trying to achieve**. Consider key tasks and motivations as to why someone would visit your site. 

Create a list of reasons why people would visit the site. Then assin the list to your hypthetical characters. 

Fourth, **what information your visitors need**. For those that are on your site, consider what information they need to achieve their goals quickly. 

You can prioritize certain information based on your target audience. Be sure to stand out for those that you want, and even those that aren't meant to be there. What kind of background info can you provide or what differntiates you from the rest. 

Fifth, **how often people visit**. Think about how often you have to update the page. Some services do not require constant updates if their service is not that demanding. The same goes with information and how often it must be updated. 

# Site Maps

After knowing what needs to on the site, organize the information into sections. Create a diagram of pages that will be used to structure the site aka **site map**. 

**Card sorting** is a technique used to help determine what information should go on what page. This is done by grouping related information pertaining to the visitor. They then can be grouped together to create different sections of the site. 

# Wireframe
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key  that will go on each page. It is like the barebones of the site, no color no style just formatting. 

# Using design for your message

+ A designer needs to priortize the information communicated on their site. 
+ Where do you want the login link, the contact us link, the about me, etc. Use some styling to make certain information pop out. A **visual hierarchy** is useful to help users focus on the key messages to draw people's attention. 
+ Group together related content.

**Symantic HTML**:
