### Growth Mindset
>I define growth mindset as the belief that no one person has a limit to learning and growth. Along with this mindset, it helps to normalize mistakes/frustration and seeing them as growth opportunities rather than limiters. 

#### How to stay in growth mindset
1. Persist through obstacles
1. Embrace challenges
1. Assess my work and see what worked and didn't
