# Classifications of Text Editors

There are many types of text editors to house coding projects. The type of text editor to use varies by the coder and their preferences. There are four important features to look for:

1. Code completion
1. Syntax completion
1. Variety of themes
1. Variety of extensions

Coders have to consider these four features becaue they will be spending most of their time on these text editors. The completion features are **essential** for a coder because even a few seconds saved add up over a long epriod. This feature also helps coders *avoid* coding mistakes or missing closing code. Viewing a screen for long periods of times can take a toll on coders eyes. It is suggested to use darker background white bright text rather than the normal white background and dark font. The extensions are like web page extensions allowing the text editor outside/extra features which may help their page or code.
