# Markdown

A few things I took away about markdown from the assigned reading is that it is basically another language with some a bit simpler (*imo*) than **html** and **CSS**.  

I do appreciate the keys to all the syntax and examples. This is how I will go about recalling these syntaxes (synatxi? :dizzy_face:)

There were two ways of emphasizing words:
1. Bold text: it is coded with **two asterisks around the text to be bolded**, be sure to close the first two asterisks!
1. Italic text: it is coded with *one asterisk around the text to be italicized*, be sure to close the first asterisk!

If I want to quote one of my favorite quotes I have to use `>` in front of each line that is part of that quote. For example, the quote
>We are all born naked,
>and the rest is drag.
>RuPaul Andres Charles 

```Though I noticed that if I hit enter in the `.md` page and start with `>` it does not respect the enter```
