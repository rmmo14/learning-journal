### Growth Mindset
>I define growth mindset as the belief that no one person has a limit to learning and growth. Along with this mindset, it helps to normalize mistakes/frustration and seeing them as growth opportunities rather than limiters. 

#### How to stay in growth mindset
1. Persist through obstacles
1. Embrace challenges
1. Assess my work and see what worked and didn't

Hello, my name is Rene Montoya. I live in Long Beach, California and I decided to use this stay-at-home order to try and learn a new skill. I am interested in coding because I want to learn new methods or old tweak old methods of math instruction/assessment. I am Salvadorian and fluent in Spanish, I like to say I'm conversational in Japanese. I studied mathematics for undergrad and grad school, emphasizing **mathematics education**. :grin:

Some of my favorite **math** topics are:
- Precalculus
- Calculus\*
  - \*Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Multivariable Calculus
- Discrete Mathematics
- Linear Algebra

## This is one of my favorite parts of my Japan trip in March 2019, the cherry blossomssss! :heart_eyes: (Thats why it's my h2)

4/27/2020 Takeaways (1b)
A few things I took away about markdown from the assigned reading is that it is basically another language with some a bit simpler (*imo*) than **html** and **CSS**.  

I do appreciate the keys to all the syntax and examples. This is how I will go about recalling these syntaxes (synatxi? :dizzy_face:)

There were two ways of emphasizing words:
1. Bold text: it is coded with **two asterisks around the text to be bolded**, be sure to close the first two asterisks!
1. Italic text: it is coded with *one asterisk around the text to be italicized*, be sure to close the first asterisk!

If I want to quote one of my favorite quotes I have to use `>` in front of each line that is part of that quote. For example, the quote
>We are all born naked,
>and the rest is drag.
>RuPaul Andres Charles 

```Though I noticed that if I hit enter in the `.md` page and start with `>` it does not respect the enter```
