Hello, my name is Rene Montoya. I live in Long Beach, California and I decided to use this stay-at-home order to try and learn a new skill. I am interested in coding because I want to learn new methods or old tweak old methods of math instruction/assessment. I am Salvadorian and fluent in Spanish, I like to say I'm conversational in Japanese. I studied mathematics for undergrad and grad school, emphasizing **mathematics education**. :grin:

Some of my favorite **math** topics are:
- Precalculus
- Calculus\*
  - \*Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Multivariable Calculus
- Discrete Mathematics
- Linear Algebra

## This is one of my favorite parts of my Japan trip in March 2019, the cherry blossomssss! :heart_eyes: (Thats why it's my h2)
