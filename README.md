### Growth Mindset
>I define growth mindset as the belief that no one person has a limit to learning and growth. Along with this mindset, it helps to normalize mistakes/frustration and seeing them as growth opportunities rather than limiters. 

#### How to stay in growth mindset
1. Persist through obstacles
1. Embrace challenges
1. Assess my work and see what worked and didn't

Hello, my name is Rene Montoya. I live in Long Beach, California and I decided to use this stay-at-home order to try and learn a new skill. I am interested in coding because I want to learn new methods or old tweak old methods of math instruction/assessment. I am from a Salvadorian background and am fluent in Spanish and I'd say conversational in Japanese. I studied mathematics for undergrad and grad school, emphasizing mathematics education. :grin:
